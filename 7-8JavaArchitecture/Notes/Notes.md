### DataTypes

Primitive => Can't be broken down into smaller datatype. String is not considered as primitive as it can be converted to Character.

Literals => In primitive datatype literals are syntactical representation of the datatype.
Identifier => Name of variable/Class etc.

Int a = 234 => a is identifier and 234 is a literal

> **_NOTE:_**  You can also write int a = 234_000_000 => 234 Million underscores get replaced by ,
